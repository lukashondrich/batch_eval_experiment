  Your task is to evaluate the following tutor messages across four dimensions:
  {{ dimension_descriptions }}
  Please evaluate each of the following messages and return a JSON object mapping each example number (as a string) to a 4-element array of scores [Lexical Complexity, Construction Complexity, Formality Level, Socratic Approach]:
  {% for msg in messages %}
  {{ msg.index }}. {{ msg.text }}
  {% endfor %}
  Provide only the JSON object.

  Your task is to evaluate the following tutor messages across four dimensions describing the complexity, formality and tutoring style of the language used.
  
  The scoring dimensions are:
  {{ dimension_descriptions }}
  
  For each message, follow these exact steps:
  1. Repeat the message text in quotes (MESSAGE: "")
  2. Analyze the message in detail, across the four dimensions (THINKING for message : "")
  3. Then provide numerical scores only after completing your analysis (SCORES for message : [x.x, x.x, x.x, x.x])
  
  {% for msg in messages %}
  Message {{ msg.index }}: "{{ msg.text }}"
  
  THINKING for message {{ msg.index }}:
  - Lexical Complexity: Start by identifying the vocabulary level. Note specific words that are simple/common or specialized/advanced. Consider whether most learners would understand the terminology without explanation.
  - Construction Complexity: Analyze sentence structure. Identify if there are simple sentences or complex ones with embedded clauses. Quote specific phrases that demonstrate complexity or simplicity.
  - Formality Level: Evaluate whether the language is informal/conversational or formal/academic. Point out specific phrases that indicate formality level.
  - Socratic Approach: Determine if the message directly provides information or uses questions to guide discovery. Note specific questioning or direct instructional techniques.
  
  SCORES for message {{ msg.index }}: [Lexical Complexity, Construction Complexity, Formality Level, Socratic Approach]
  {% endfor %}
  
  After completing your analysis of all messages, provide ONLY the JSON object on a new line after:
  
  FINAL_JSON_OUTPUT:
  {"1": [x.x, x.x, x.x, x.x], "2": [x.x, x.x, x.x, x.x], ...}

  Your task is to evaluate the following tutoring message across four dimensions:
  {{ dimension_descriptions }}
  
  Message: "{{ message }}"
  
  For this message, you MUST first show your detailed analysis of each dimension, and only then give scores. DO NOT skip the analysis step.
  
  THINKING:
  - Lexical Complexity: [your-analysis-here]
  - Construction Complexity: [your-analysis-here]
  - Formality Level: [your-analysis-here]
  - Socratic Approach: [your-analysis-here]
  
  After your analysis, provide ONLY the JSON object on a new line after:
  
  FINAL_JSON_OUTPUT:
  {"{{ message_id }}": [x.x, x.x, x.x, x.x]}

dimension_descriptions: |
  Evaluate each tutoring message on these dimensions (0.0 = low, 1.0 = high):
  
  1. Lexical Complexity (Lexical Complexity):
     - 0.0: Elementary vocabulary, common words
     - 1.0: Advanced, specialized terminology
  
  2. Construction Complexity (Construction Complexity):
     - 0.0: Simple sentences, basic structures
     - 1.0: Complex embedded clauses, advanced constructions
  
  3. Formality Level (Formality Level):
     - 0.0: Very informal, conversational
     - 1.0: Highly formal, academic
  
  4. Socratic Approach:
     - 0.0: Direct statements, giving information
     - 1.0: Question-based exploration, guiding discovery
